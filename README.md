# CS253-TermProject
This is the final version of my term project for CS253 (Fall 2017). 

It includes the following features:
* Given a document, will rank additionally provided documents by similarity and reading level
* Estimates the reading level of a document per the Coleman-Laiu index
* Computes similarity using TFIDF - Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (used by early web browsers)
* Performs word stemming using the Porter Algorithm 
* Is extremely efficient - without multithreading, it can compare the complete works of William Shakespeare in about 3 seconds

It is written in C++.
